I wrote this application purely for myself. After working with MySQL, I am often too lazy to ping the server through the console + enter a command for shutdown... So this application performs exactly two functions: it checks the status of the server and turns it off. Before checking the server status, enter the account name, with permission to shut down the server, and the password to it.
